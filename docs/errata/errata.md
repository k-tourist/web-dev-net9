Packt publishes Early Access editions of some of their books. They are available on the website via Packt subscription. The content uses preliminary drafts of books that will change during the writing and editing process. Once the final version is signed off by author and publisher, the paperback, Kindle, and other ebook formats are produced. The final step is to update the Early Access online web edition to match the published edition but sometimes this process takes up to a week after publish date. 

In the Early Access edition of this book, *Chapter 1* included the following package versions for testing in the `Directory.Packages.props` file:
```xml
<ItemGroup Label="For unit testing.">
  <PackageVersion Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.2" />
  <PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="18.0.0" />
  <PackageVersion Include="xunit" Version="2.9.0" />
  <PackageVersion Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="3.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

But in the final published editions they are as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<ItemGroup Label="For testing.">
  <PackageVersion Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.2" />
  <PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.11.1" />
  <PackageVersion Include="xunit" Version="2.9.2" />
  <!--The following package was still a preview on .NET 9 release day.-->
  <PackageVersion Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="3.0.0-pre.49" />
  <PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.Playwright" Version="1.49.0" />
  <PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing" Version="9.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

And remember to check if a newer package version has been released. For example, the `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` package is already now `17.12.0`, so I updated the solution code in the book's GitHub repository.

In the paragraph that leads in to the numbered steps, I wrote, "Azure SQL Edge requires a 64-bit processor (either x64 or ARM64), with a minimum of one processor and 1 GB RAM on the host:"

In the next edition, I will simplify that statement to the following, "Azure SQL Edge requires a 64-bit processor (either x64 or ARM64), with a minimum of 1 GB RAM on the host:"
