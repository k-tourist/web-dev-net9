# Page 33 - Creating a class library for entity models

> Thanks to [P9avel](https://github.com/P9avel) for raising [this issue on January 2, 2025](https://github.com/markjprice/web-dev-net9/issues/5).

At the end of Step 1, there is a note that says, "You can target either .NET 8 (LTS) or .NET 9 (STS) for all the projects in this book but you should be consistent. If you choose .NET 9 for the class libraries, then choose .NET 9 for later MVC and Web API projects."

This does not mean that you can download or clone the solution projects and then only change the target framework from `net9.0` to `net8.0` and it will work. What I meant is that you can choose to target .NET 8 when you create all the projects. Some of the project templates have changed between .NET 8 and .NET 9, especially the Aspire templates. Just changing the target version after project creation won't be enough. In the next edition, I will remove this note since every reader should want to target `net10.0` anyway.

# Chapter 13 - Installing Umbraco CMS

In Step 1, I wrote the command to install project templates for Umbraco CMS version 14.2, as shown in the following command:
```
dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates::14.2.0
```

This installs three project templates, as shown in the following output:
```
Templates            Short Name          Language
-------------------------------------------------
Umbraco Project      umbraco             [C#]
Umbraco Package RCL  umbracopackage-rcl  [C#]
Umbraco Package      umbracopackage      [C#]
```

If you do not explicitly specify the version, then the latest version will be installed. At the time of writing in December 2024, that is version 15.0.0. This installs three project templates, as shown in the following output:
```
Templates               Short Name         Language
---------------------------------------------------
Umbraco Docker Compose  umbraco-compose            
Umbraco Extension       umbraco-extension  [C#]    
Umbraco Project         umbraco            [C#]    
```

Since we are only using the **Umbraco Project** / `umbraco` project template, the other project templates don't matter.

I recommend that you use version 14.2.0 as I did in the book. If you choose to install a later version like 15.0.0 then be prepared for changes to behavior.

> **Warning!** You might need to restart Visual Studio to see newly added project templates.

> **Note**: The next edition will use Umbraco CMS version 17.0.0 which will be an LTS release that targets .NET 10.
